# Final Project
 
This project will document the development of Hong Kongâ€™s Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill movement which has been ongoing since June 2019. This is an individual project. 

## Data Source

1) Hong Kong Police Force Press Releases https://www.police.gov.hk/ppp_en/03_police_message/pr/index.php 

2) Poll results by the Centre for Communication and Public Opinion Survey, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (in Chinese) http://video3.mingpao.com/inews/201910/20191015_mpsurvey.pdf 

## Data acquisition/analysis/visualization (current status)

I scraped the October press release table from the police website and manually compiled the list of protestor activities. A trial of visualization was conducted using a Flourish time map template.

The poll results showed the percentage of respondents who said they had no trust in Hong Kong police increased from 6.5% in May to 22.5% in June to 42.7% in August to 48.3 percent in September to 51.5% in October.

## Visual planning

1) A time map showing how the Hong Kong protests became more and more violent during the months. A test of October data can be found here https://app.flourish.studio/visualisation/942365/edit 

2) A vertical bar chart showing the number of protest activities by week, with a line on top of it showing increasing distrust of the police and scrollytelling major events.

3) Small multiples of major locations for protest activities, showing how the activities intensified by plotting monthly totals
