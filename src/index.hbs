  If you want to use something exported from ai2html...
    1. Rename the exported .html file to .hbs
    2. Put the .hbs file inside of 'html/story'
    3. Move the exported images to the images folder
    4. Include the partial normally like below
  -->

{{!-- {{> story/illustrator_demo }} --}}

  You can also put the actual HTML here if you really want to,
  although it's a little less organized looking
-->

<div class="story-body">
    <p><a href="https://github.com/gracelinan/Final_project">Link</a> to GitHub repository </p>
</div>
