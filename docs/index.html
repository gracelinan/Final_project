But Beijing has been accused in recent years of increasingly interfering in the former British colony’s affairs.</p> <p>The protests which started in June to oppose an extradition bill have turned violent with no signs of ending anytime soon. The bill was worrisome to many because it would place Hong Kongers in danger of being sent to China to be tried in the Communist Party-controlled courts. Even though the Hong Kong government announced a formal withdrawal of the bill in late October, the protests continued. </p>
</div> <div class="story-body"> <h2>Escalating</h2> <p>The time map below displays protest activities over time during the anti-extradition bill movement, extracting data from press releases by the <a href="https://www.police.gov.hk/ppp_en/03_police_message/pr/index.php">Hong Kong Police Force</a>.</p> <p>Despite the date source being police records, demonstrations clearly took place more frequently and more violent acts were committed in the latter months of the movement. Protests also expanded to more districts of the city, rather than concentrating in Admiralty where the government headquarters is located.</p> <div class="flourish-embed" data-src="visualisation/942365" data-width="100%"></div><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script> </div>

This was followed by a large-scale strike participated by students and workers on the first day of school in September. <br> Police were accused of excessive violence during their clashes with protesters and nearly 50% of people polled said they had no trust in Hong Kong police by mid-September. </p> </div> <div class="step" id="third-stage"> <p>A series of violent conflicts between the police and protestors took place on the week of China’s National Day on October 1. An 18-year-old student was shot by the police. <br> A poll in mid-October showed more than half of respondents had no confidence in the police. </p> </div> <div class="step" id="fourth-stage"> <p>The extradition bill was formally withdrawn on October 23, but protests continued. Another big strike took place on November 11, followed by police siege of two university campuses occupied by protesters that lasted for most of the rest of the month.</p> </div> </div>
